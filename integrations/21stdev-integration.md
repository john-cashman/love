# 21stdev Integration

Most AI-generated landing pages look the same—vague sections, off-brand colors, and no personality. But it doesn’t have to be that way.

We are going to share a structured workflow using Lovable and 21stdev that creates landing pages clients _actually_ love (like [this one](https://lovable.dev/projects/35d72d2e-6e25-40e5-9b0c-c0d1a7c1b727)).

### Step-by-step guide

From design inspiration to final polish, here’s the step-by-step guide he uses to build fast without sacrificing quality:

#### Start with Design Inspiration, Not a Prompt

Before writing a single word of prompt, browse [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) or [Behance](https://www.behance.net/). Look for designs with:

```
- Clean typography and spacing
- Clear CTAs and minimal layout
- Subtle interactions (not overdesigned)


```

#### Start with a blank project

Start your Lovable project by prompting:

#### Convert WebP to PNG and Prep Your Design Screenshot&#x20;

Once you find your reference design, download it. If it saves in WebP format, use an online converter to change it to PNG so it can be easily used in Lovable or GPT workflows.

#### Turn Inspiration into a Detailed Prompt Using Chat Mode

Use Lovable [Chat Mode](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/labs#chat-mode) to extract:

```
- Page sections (hero, features, FAQ, etc.)
- Layout structure, spacing, and content order
- Font families, color palettes, and gradients
- Animation types, hover effects, and transitions



You can even ask Lovable chat mode to elaborate on sections or rewrite the prompt with better UX suggestions.
```

#### Generate the First Draft with Lovable

Paste the detailed prompt into Lovable Edit Mode. Then:

```
- Upload your PNG screenshot as a reference
- Add notes like "_Use Space Grotesque font_" or "Use Unsplash for blog thumbnails"

This combo leads to far more accurate designs than vague, single-sentence prompts.

```

#### Edit in Real Time: Visual + Text Prompts

Use Lovable’s [visual editing tool](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/visual-edit) to:

```
- Resize images (e.g., "make this image 800px wide")
- Position hero images (e.g., "place this image on the right side")
- Align design sections with the reference image

Combine this with natural language edits for precision.
```

#### Polish the Design with 21stdev Components

Use [21stdev](https://21st.dev/)’s prebuilt UI components to upgrade:

```
<figure><img src="/images/21stdev.png" alt="21stdev custom component "><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

- Hero sections
- Navigation bars with hover effects
- Testimonial layouts
- CTAs and feature grids

Find a component you like, copy the prompt, and paste it into Lovable. Be sure to match the visual tone with the rest of the site.
```

#### Fix AI Misinterpretations

AI saves time, but expect cleanup:

```

- Adjust branding (Lovable defaults to blue)
- Improve spacing and padding manually
- Use consistent typography throughout
- Add gradients or depth for a non-flat look

Make the design feel _intentional_, not "default."
```

#### Optimize for Mobile (Non-Negotiable)

Don’t skip this. Ensure:

```
<figure><img src="/images/mobile-responsive.png" alt="Mobile Responsive website"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

- Inputs go full-width
- Font sizes adapt to smaller screens
- Buttons are tap-friendly
- Sections stack well and scroll smoothly

Mobile UX is critical for conversions.
```

#### Add Light Animations and Microinteractions

To modernize the feel:

```
- Use fade-ins for hero sections
- Add button hover effects
- Animate sections on scroll
- Use subtle background movement

Lovable can integrate [Framer Motion](https://motion.dev/) out-of-the-box if prompted right.

```

#### Generate Custom Visuals with AI (Optional)

Craft prompts for ChatGPT, Midjourney or Ideogram based on your favorite elements from the reference design.

```
**Steps:**


This is especially useful for 3D visuals or thematic illustrations.
```

### Why This Approach Works?

AI isn't magic. But with structure, it becomes a superpower. Compared to unstructured prompting:

* The first draft is 10x closer to done
* You spend less time fixing errors
* Every section has a purpose
* The final product feels custom, not cookie-cutter

It’s a blend of automation **+** craftsmanship.

### Key Takeaways

* Start with strong visual inspiration
* Use structured prompts with Lovable Chat Mode
* Add screenshots and clarify expectations
* Upgrade sections using 21stdev components
* Fix design quirks and optimize for mobile
* Animate where it matters
* Deploy fast, iterate faster

This is the workflow [Prajwal](https://x.com/PrajwalTomar_/status/1902371273147064772) uses everyday for his clients - that we tried in-house - to build fast, beautiful, high-converting landing pages—powered by Lovable AI but guided by intention.

Happy Building!
