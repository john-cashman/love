Lovable makes it easy to integrate AI services into your web applications. Whether you want to build an AI-powered landing page, a text-generation tool, or a full SaaS app, Lovable's built-in integrations with services like [**OpenAI**](https://platform.openai.com/)**, **[**Groq**](https://console.groq.com/keys)**, **[**Claude**](https://www.anthropic.com/api)**, **[**Deepseek**](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/)**, and **[**Mistral**](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/) make it possible without writing backend code. Here's how to do it: 

### Choose the AI Feature You Need
Before you start building, define what you want the AI to do:

    - Generate or enhance text (e.g. email writer, tweet generator)
    - Classify or summarize content
    - Analyze images
    - Personalize responses
    - Integrate with a specific LLM API

### Plan with Prompts First
Use Lovable's chat interface to describe your feature in simple terms. For example:

    ```
    Build an email enhancement tool. The user should write an email, then click buttons to make it more professional, concise, or friendly using Groq API.
    ```

    Lovable will scaffold the UI, suggest components, and let you preview the app quickly.

### Connect to a Backend with Supabase
AI features often need backend logic. Supabase provides:

    - Database for user data
    - Auth for login/signup
    - Edge Functions for calling external APIs securely

    
Set up Supabase early in your project to avoid UI/backend mismatches.

### Use Edge Functions for AI Calls
To safely call AI APIs, create an Edge Function inside Lovable:

    - Store your secret API keys (like OpenAI or Groq) in Lovable's secret manager
    - Let Lovable generate the edge function code
    - Ensure you use function calling if your API returns structured data (e.g. calories, macros, tweet threads)

    **Prompt Example:**

    ```
    Use GPT-4 and function calling to extract nutrition info from a meal description. Save the results to the backend.
    ```

    
Structure your OpenAI function calling schema with defined fields like:

      ```
      {
        "name": "extract_nutrition",
        "parameters": 
      }
      ```

### Make It Interactive
Add buttons or form actions for:

    - Submitting text to the AI
    - Uploading an image
    - Toggling between modes (concise vs friendly tone)

    Lovable lets you:

    - Attach functions to buttons
    - Animate interactions
    - Show real-time results with minimal prompting

    
Use screenshots and phrases like "make this smoother" to guide the design.

    
**Advanced UX Tip:** Implement side-by-side live previews of the AI response. Use left/right layout blocks or tabs to let users compare outputs.

### Use External Services (Optional)
Some popular integrations for AI workflows:

    - **Resend** – send emails after form submission
    - **Groq API** – blazing fast LLM inference
    - **Stripe** – paywall access to AI tools
    - **Replicate** – generate or transform images

    **Prompt Example:**

    ```
    When a user submits the contact form, send an email using Resend and store the message in Supabase.
    ```

    
**Payments Tip:** Lock advanced AI features behind a Stripe subscription. Use conditional flows like:

      ```
      if (user.isPaid)  else 
      ```

### Test and Iterate
- Use preview links to test mobile responsiveness
    - Check performance with multiple API calls
    - Share your project for feedback
    - Use chat history to revert changes or refactor

### Publish and Promote
When you're ready:

    - Deploy with a single click
    - Use [Lovable Launch](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched) to get visibility
    - Add OG tags and SEO title/description in the meta panel
    - Submit your app to Product Hunt, communities, and social media

## **Debug and Improve Prompts**

- Be specific with system messages: "You are a helpful nutritionist."
- Test function calling by mocking inputs.
- Use `console.log()` inside edge functions to trace logic.
- Use screenshots when asking Lovable to debug a layout.

**Prompt Tip:** If the AI fails to use your context (e.g. user's meals), say:

```
Make sure all of the user's meals are included in the prompt to GPT-4.
```

### Troubleshooting

  <details>
<summary>Missing data in AI prompts?</summary>
Make sure you include context like user history or previous entries.
</details>
  <details>
<summary>UI not updating?</summary>
Use chat-only mode to debug one step at a time.
</details>
  <details>
<summary>Secret keys exposed?</summary>
Always add them via the Secrets panel, not directly in the chat.
</details>
  <details>
<summary>Streaming issues with Groq/OpenAI?</summary>
Ensure `stream: true` is supported.
</details>
  <details>
<summary>Image uploads not working?</summary>
Use file inputs and convert to base64 or upload via Supabase Storage.
</details>
  <details>
<summary>Edge Function fails silently?</summary>
View Edge Function logs in Lovable's function editor or Supabase dashboard.
</details>
