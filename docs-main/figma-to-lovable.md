You can now export Figma designs directly to Lovable using Builder.io's native integration. No devs needed. This guide shows you how to structure your design, export it, and turn it into a full-stack app—all in one smooth flow.

## Why This Integration Changes Everything

Designers no longer have to stop at mockups.

With Builder.io, you can transform Figma designs into clean, structured code.

With Lovable, you turn that code into functional, full-stack apps—using AI.

## Step-by-Step: Figma to Full-Stack App

### Structure Your Figma Design
For smooth exporting, your Figma file needs to be well-organized. Here's how to prepare:

    #### Use Auto-Layout (Required for Precise Mode)

    - Apply Auto-Layout to all parent containers.
    - Use proper **padding, spacing, and resizing** rules.
    - Set horizontal/vertical resizing for responsive layouts.

    #### Name Your Layers Clearly

    - Use names like `Header`, `CTA Button`, `Nav Bar`—not `Frame 23`.
    - Avoid symbols and nested clutter.
    - Group similar components logically.

    #### Build Reusable Components

    - Use consistent styling (fonts, colors, etc.).
    - Turn repeated elements into **Figma components**.

    #### Think in Design Systems

    - Apply global styles.
    - Use a shared component library if available.
