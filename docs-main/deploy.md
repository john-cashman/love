Once your web app is ready, you can **deploy it** and share it with the world. You also have the option to **share a work-in-progress version** to gather feedback before going live. Lovable makes it simple to publish, iterate, and distribute your applications with just a few clicks.

## Publishing your app

When your project is ready, **publish it to generate a shareable URL.** This makes it easy to showcase your application or share it with collaborators and stakeholders.

### How to Publish Your App

### Step 1
In the top right corner of the **editor view**, click the **Publish** button (globe icon).

Your application is now **live**, and you can access it via the provided link.

    

### Step 6

    Previewing allows you to **see your latest changes** without affecting the live, published version.

    To preview:

    1. Open the **Publish** dialog.
    2. Locate the **Preview** section.
    3. Click the generated **preview link** to view or share your work-in-progress updates.

    The preview link is generated instantly and can be shared with team members for feedback.

### Step 7
If you want to rename the subdomain or your project name:

    1. Go to **Settings**.
    2. Choose a better name under the project name section.
    3. Click **Rename Project**.
    4. Just remember to **republish** to update the subdomain and reflect changes publicly.
