We've since expanded its capabilities, making it feel like you're chatting with a technology expert who understands your projects and goals inside and out.

    However, these advanced features come with additional costs, so **messages sent in Chat Mode will now count towards your message limit**:

    - 1 Chat Mode message = 1 Edit Mode message = 1 message
    - All pricing tiers have access to Chat Mode
    - There will be no separate message count in settings for Chat Mode

    We're excited to keep improving Chat Mode and appreciate your continued feedback\!
