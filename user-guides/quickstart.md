### Start your Project

There are several ways to get started with Lovable, depending on your preferences and resources:

  <details>
<summary>Prompt</summary>
Lovable‚Äôs prompt-based system makes app creation simple.

    - Just describe what you want to build in the prompt box.
    - The more specific you are, the better the results.
    - Start with clear and detailed prompts.
    - You can refine and adjust your project as you go.

    
### Example:
_"Create a dashboard with user login, monthly sales in a line chart, and customer demographics in a pie chart."_

</details>
  <details>
<summary>Templates</summary>

### Step 1
Lovable offers [templates](https://lovable.dev/templates) to help you get started quickly on popular project types, such as dashboards, e-commerce sites, or social apps, for a quick setup.

### Step 2
Once the template loads, use prompts to adjust features, add new elements, or fine-tune the design to match your vision.

</details>
  <details>
<summary>Remix an Existing Project</summary>

    You can remix an existing public project or one of your own. Remixing allows you to reuse the current state of a project as a starting point and build upon it. It‚Äôs a great way to explore new ideas, make adjustments, or iterate with different changes while preserving the original version.

    
Note that it is not possible to remix projects when Supabase is connected.

</details>
  <details>
<summary>Using Figma</summary>
If you have a design in Figma,

    1. **Using screenshots:** Take a screenshot of any part of it. You can paste the screenshot directly into Lovable or drag-and-drop the image file. Once you press Enter, Lovable will convert your design into functional code.
    2. **Using Builder.io integration:** First, structure your Figma design using Auto-Layout and clear layer naming. Then, open the Builder.io plugin in Figma, select your design, and click "Open in Lovable" to generate a fully functional app. [More information here.](https://lovable.dev/blog/2025-01-22-figma-to-lovable-builder-io-native-integration)
</details>
  <details>
<summary>Using a Sketch</summary>

### Step 1
Use [**Excalidraw**](https://excalidraw.com/) or any similar tool to sketch your UI.

### Step 2
Take a screenshot of your drawing, then paste or drag-and-drop it into Lovable.

### Step 3
The platform will transform your sketch into working code.

</details>
  <details>
<summary>Cloning a Website or Application</summary>
If you want to replicate an existing webpage,

    

### Step 1
Take a screenshot using shortcuts like _Cmd\+Shift\+4_ on Mac or tools like the [GoFullPage Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl).

### Step 2
Paste or drag the screenshot into Lovable
