Once your web app is ready, you can **deploy it** and share it with the world. You also have the option to **share a work-in-progress version** to gather feedback before going live. Lovable makes it simple to publish, iterate, and distribute your applications with just a few clicks.

Your published app will be accessible to anyone with the link. Make sure
  you're ready to share before publishing\!

## Publishing your app

When your project is ready, **publish it to generate a shareable URL.** This makes it easy to showcase your application or share it with collaborators and stakeholders.

### How to Publish Your App

### Step 1
In the top right corner of the **editor view**, click the **Publish** button (globe icon).

### Step 4
Once deployment is complete, you'll see a **Update** button for future updates.

    
Easily surface security vulnerabilities in your app before publishing with Lovableâ€™s new Security Scan feature. You will find the results of the scan in the publish dialog for Supabase-enabled apps.

### Step 5
Your application is now **live**, and you can access it via the provided link.

    
1. The publishing process typically takes less than a minute. You'll receive a
         notification once it's complete.
      2. We've added an option in the project settings to **show or hide the Lovable badge** on your deployed app. You can customize this setting before publishing.

### Step 6

### **Use previewing for iterative development**
- Previewing is very handy as it allows you and others to view the latest changes without affecting the live, published version of your application.
      - We've noticed users using it for iterative development and getting real-time feedback, as well as for collaborative reviews and testing before final deployment.

    Previewing allows you to **see your latest changes** without affecting the live, published version.

    To preview:

    1. Open the **Publish** dialog.
    2. Locate the **Preview** section.
    3. Click the generated **preview link** to view or share your work-in-progress updates.

    The preview link is generated instantly and can be shared with team members for feedback.

### Step 7
If you want to rename the subdomain or your project name:

    1. Go to **Settings**.
    2. Choose a better name under the project name section.
    3. Click **Rename Project**.
    4. Just remember to **republish** to update the subdomain and reflect changes publicly.
