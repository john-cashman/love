We also built a platform, similar to Product Hunt, called [**Lovable Launched**](https://launched.lovable.dev/) where you can publish your app to get in front of thousands of people.

### Publish Your App on Lovable Launched
The first easy thing you can do is to submit your app to [**Lovable Launched**](https://launched.lovable.dev/) so others can discover and vote on it. The more engagement you get, the higher your visibility on the platform.

    

### Drive Upvotes & Engagement
An amazing way to get first users is through social media:

    - **Post on Social Media:** Share your app and launch on **X (Twitter), LinkedIn, and other platforms**. If you tag @lovable_dev on X we will usually repost and help amplify your reach.
    - **Ask for Support:** Encourage your network — friends, colleagues, and online communities — to upvote your project on Lovable Launched.
    - **Include a Direct Link:** We recommend including a **direct link** to your Lovable Launched page in your posts to make it easy for people to vote.

## Best practices 

Launching a product is exciting—but getting people to actually use it? That’s the real challenge. Whether you’re rolling out a side project, a SaaS tool, or a community-driven app, your **first 100 users** set the foundation for everything that follows. This isn’t about magic hacks or vanity metrics. It’s about practical, low-cost strategies to get real users who care about what you’re building.

<summary>Tap Into Existing Networks</summary>
Your first users are likely in communities you’re already part of—whether it’s a Slack group, a subreddit, or a personal Twitter following. Instead of spamming, be genuinely helpful and mention your product when relevant.

    ### Where to Start:

    - **Identify personal connections** (friends, colleagues, acquaintances) who might benefit from your product.
    - **Engage in online communities** relevant to your product's niche (e.g., Reddit, Indie Hackers, Discord groups).
    - **Participate** authentically, offering value before mentioning your product.
    - **Find relevant industry groups** in Slack, Twitch or Telegram and engage authentically.

    👉 [Example] If you’re launching a dev tool, start by helping people in **r/webdev** or **r/programming** and mention your tool naturally when it fits.

<summary>Validate Ideas and Continuously Test</summary>
Before going all in, **validate demand and optimize conversion rates**.

    ### Where to Start:

    - **Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** to test with early users and gather feedback.
    - **Conduct A/B testing** on different aspects of your product and marketing strategies to determine what resonates best.
    - **Analyze data** to make informed decisions and iterate on your product or approach accordingly.

    👉 [Example] A startup tested two landing pages: One focused on **features**, the other on **user pain points**. The pain-point-focused page had **3x better conversion.**

<summary>Content Marketing & SEO</summary>
People search for solutions every day. If you can create content that solves their problems, you’ll get users—organically.

    ### Where to Start:

    - Create **solution-focused content** (blog posts, tutorials, case studies) addressing your target audience's pain points.
    - **Optimize content** for long-tail keywords with low competition to improve search engine visibility.
    - **Repurpose content** into different formats (e.g., turning a blog post into a video or infographic) to reach a broader audience.

    👉 [Example] If you’re launching a code deployment tool, write **“How to Deploy Your App in 3 Minutes”**, optimize it for search, and share it in dev communities.

<summary>Offer Incentives & Lead Magnets</summary>
People love free stuff—especially when it’s valuable. Lead magnets help you build an email list of potential users who actually care about your product.

<summary>Use Social Media (the Right Way)</summary>
Posting about your launch once won’t cut it. Instead, create value-driven content that naturally attracts attention.

    - **Interact** with followers by responding to comments and messages promptly.
    - **Join and contribute** to groups and discussions where your target audience is active.

    - Craft **personalized, short, non-spammy** messages that address specific needs or challenges of the recipient.
    - **Offer value upfront**, such as exclusive access or personalized demos, without being overly promotional.

<summary>Consider Paid Acquisition (As a Last Resort)</summary>
While organic methods are cost-effective and build a loyal user base, there might come a time when you consider paid acquisition to scale your efforts. However, it's essential to approach this cautiously to ensure a positive return on investment (ROI).

    ### **Where to Start:**

    - **Set a modest budget:** Begin with a small budget to test the waters without significant financial risk.
    - **Target specific audiences:** Use platforms like Google Ads or Facebook Ads to reach users who fit your ideal customer profile.
    - **Monitor and adjust:** Regularly track the performance of your ads. If certain campaigns aren't delivering results, tweak or discontinue them.
    - **Optimize landing pages:** Ensure that the pages users land on are compelling and relevant, increasing the chances of conversion.

    Remember, while paid acquisition can provide a quick influx of users, it's crucial to balance it with organic strategies to build a sustainable and engaged community.
