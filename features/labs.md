## What is Labs?

These experimental features may change or be removed at any time.

You can access Labs from your [Account Setting tab](https://lovable.dev/settings/account) in the Lovable Editor.

## **GitHub Branch Switching**

Select the branch to make edits to in your GitHub repository. To switch branches in GitHub through the Lovable editor:

1. Enter your project.
2. Go to Project Settings
3. Go to GitHub
4. Click the branch dropdown, and choose the branch you want to switch to.

### ### **Important Notes:**
- Commit or stash any uncommitted changes before switching branches
  - If you encounter "Branch not found" errors, pull the latest changes from the remote repository first
  - If you can't switch branches, check if you have untracked files that would be overwritten
  - Branch switching will change all files in your workspace to match that branch
  - Lovable primarily syncs with your repository's default branch (usually main)
